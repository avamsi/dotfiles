# Snippet below worked best on Linux (with colors e.t.c. working well) but looks
# like script on macOS is different and the much simplified snippet above works
# just as well (although it pipes I/O instead of triggering a command).
# Note: for whatever reason, output from jj commands need a reset after indent.

# 	IFS=$'\n'
# 	for line in $(script -efq /dev/null -c $cmd); do
# 		print "\t$line"
